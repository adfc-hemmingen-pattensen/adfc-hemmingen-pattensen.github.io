Sequence and Graph diagrams in your markdown files!
=========================

`mermaid-filter` is a pandoc filter that adds support for [mermaid](http://knsv.github.io/mermaid/) syntax diagrams in markdown.

Write your diagrams in fenced code blocks as usual like this:

    ~~~mermaid
    sequenceDiagram
        Alice->>John: Hello John, how are you?
        John-->>Alice: Great!
    ~~~


and get this in rendered doc <img

width="100%"/>

Installation and usage
---------------------

1. `npm install --global mermaid-filter`
2. To convert your markdown file `something.md` into `something.html`, use `pandoc -t html -F mermaid-filter -o something.html something.md`


**WINDOWS** - you need `mermaid-filter.cmd` in the line above

**Windows 8.1** - On windows 8.1, `mermaid-filter.cmd` fails - apparently due to change in how the CMD.exe works
for subprocesses? - see this [issue thread](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/issues/3458).
You have to edit the globally installed `mermaid-filter.cmd` located in `c:\users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\npm`
to use `~dp$PATH:0`.
Unfortunately, you will need to do this each time you install/update mermaid-filter since it overwrites the cmd file.

Options
--------------------

You have a couple of formatting options via attributes of the fenced code block to control the rendering

- Image Format - Use `{.mermaid format=svg}`     Default is png
- Width  - Use `{.mermaid width=400}`     default with is 500
- Theme - Use `{.mermaid theme=forest}` default is 'default'. Corresponds to `--theme`  flag of mermaid.cli
- Save path - Use `{.mermaid loc=img}`  default loc=inline which will
  encode the image in a `data uri` scheme.
    - Possible values for `loc`
        - `loc=inline` - default; encode image to data uri on img tag.
            - For widest compatibility, use png (default)
            - SVG has trouble on IE11
        - `loc=imgur` - upload png to imgur and link to it.
        - `loc=<anythingelse>` -treat as folder name to place images into

Note that to specify options, you need to use the curly braces syntax and have the `.mermaid` class attached.
Admittedly, this is uglier than the earlier syntax on top - but that's how Pandoc wants it.

JSON and CSS configuration
---------------------------

Mermaid cli allows you to specify additional options in a json configuration file and a css file. `mermaid-filter`
will look in the current directory for `.mermaid-config.json` and `.mermaid.css` and if found, pass them in to 
mermaid cli.
